# The Metadata Annotations Ontology 
An ontology that offers generic metadata annotations.

This repository provides an ontology of generic metadata annotations, such as 'Creator', 'Definition', etc. 
It can be used with any ontology to provide metadata on the ontology itself, or on its constructs (classes, relational properties, individuals, etc.). 

## Features
- **Neutrality** - The Metadata Annotations Ontology aims to be neutral with respect to universe of discourse (target domain, topic area, etc.). 
- **Minimal commitments** - The ontology aims to may little to no commitments, ontological or otherwise. It does not use other ontologies, and therefore does not commit or force the user to import other ontologies. 
- **Formalism** - The current version is in OWL, but aims to be formalized or represented in other knowledge representation languages.
